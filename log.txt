    Implemented UDP emulator and test client
    
    Test client for sending message to the emulator
    2queues in emulator
    2 pthread child constant checks if queue is empty.  If not then send out
    message every d second
    I might misinterpretate.  Going to change to each elements stays in
    queue for d seconds instead of popping queue every 2 seconds
